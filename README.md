# Simple framework to integrate threat modeling into Agile
AKA a ethnographic approach to security development
## Note
The framework has been generated with the help of ChatGPT

## Why
Bringing threat modeling into Agile using attacker-based user stories can make security risks more visible and manageable during development
## How
You're essentially flipping traditional user stories to write abuser stories or threat stories, which describe how an attacker might exploit weaknesses. These stories can then be addressed like any other backlog item.

## Follows a framework we can use
#### üß† Structure of an Attacker Story

    As an attacker, I want to [action/technique] so that I can [impact].

Example:

    As an attacker, I want to inject SQL code in the login form so that I can bypass authentication and access user accounts.

#### üîÑ How to Integrate into Agile

- Add to the Product Backlog -> Include threat stories alongside user stories.
- Link to User Stories\Features -> Every user story (e.g., "As a user, I want to log in") should be evaluated for potential threat stories.
- Define Acceptance Criteria for Threat Mitigation: Add security controls as criteria
  - Input validation is enforced
  - Parameterized queries are used.
- Use STRIDE or CAPEC to Guide Threat Discovery. Generally we use STRIDE to help identify what type of threats to consider.
- Sprint Planning & Refinement -> Discuss threat stories during refinement.
- Prioritize critical threats using a qualitative risk management approach

### üîß Sample Attacker Story Template

    Title: SQL Injection in Login
    
    **As** a malicious user  
    **I want to** inject SQL code in the login form  
    **So that I can** bypass authentication and access restricted data
    
    **Related user story**: As a user, I want to log in with my email and password.
    
    **Acceptance criteria**:
    - Input validation is enforced
    - Prepared statements are used
    - Login failures are logged and rate-limited

## Create a threat catalog
Follows an example of a catalog used to prioritize threats

## Cons to keep in mind using this framewor

1. Requires Threat Knowledge.
Crafting meaningful abuser stories demands a solid understanding of threat modeling, attacker tactics (e.g., from MITRE ATT&CK), and the system architecture. Without that, the stories may be too generic or miss real threats.

1. Risk of Overwhelming the Backlog
Abuser stories can multiply quickly. If not prioritized well, they may clutter the backlog, dilute focus, or paralyze teams with too many ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios.

1. Hard to Define 'Done'
It can be tricky to set clear acceptance criteria for security stories. ‚ÄúSecure‚Äù is often a moving target, and validating proper mitigation may require more effort than for functional stories.

1. Potential for Team Pushback
Dev teams unfamiliar with security practices might see abuser stories as a distraction from delivering features, especially under tight deadlines.

1. Security Work May Be Deferred
In Agile, lower-priority stories are often postponed. If security stories compete with feature stories, they may not be addressed in time, creating risks.

1. Difficult to Automate
Unlike functional tests, verifying security controls often requires manual testing or specialized tools. This reduces test coverage and slows feedback loops.

1. Lack of Standardization
There‚Äôs no common format or best practice for writing abuser stories, which can lead to inconsistency between teams and sprints.

1. May Not Cover Non-Application Threats
This approach focuses on application-level threats but may overlook infrastructure, supply chain, or human-factor risks unless expanded carefully.
