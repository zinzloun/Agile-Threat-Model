# Microsoft 365 Threat Modeling

Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Office 365) is a cloud-based suite of productivity applications and services. When designing and deploying applications in this environment, it's crucial to consider potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Common Threats
1. **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Microsoft 365.
2. **Phishing Attacks**: Attempts to trick users into providing personal information or credentials.
3. **Malware**: Infections that could spread through applications like Word or Excel.

## Threat Modeling Steps
1. **Identify Assets**: Determine what data and applications need protection.
2. **Identify Threats**: Use frameworks like STRIDE to identify potential threats.
3. **Assess Risks**: Evaluate the impact and likelihood of identified threats.
4. **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks.

## Best Practices
- Regularly update and patch applications.
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accounts.
- Conduct employee training on security awareness.

## Conclusion
Threat modeling is an ongoing process. Regularly revisiting and updating threat models will help in maintaining a secure environment in Microsoft 365.
